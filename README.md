# What is this?

These are my [Klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper) configs for my 3D printers. This repo is mostly intended for my personal use (aka: no guarantees this README is up-to-date), but feel free to snag any useful snippets.

# Printers
## Ender 3
My Ender 3 is an early model, currently using: 
* SKR Mini E3 v2.0 board 
* Micro Swiss direct drive 
* Micro Swiss all-metal hotend
* Genuine BLTouch v3
* 50w hotend heater
* 500w 120VAC bed heater

## TronXY X5SA Pro
My X5SA Pro is an updated model, with several nitpicks from earlier models fixed (to my pleasant surprise). Currently upgrading it, so I'll try and remember to update this later.
